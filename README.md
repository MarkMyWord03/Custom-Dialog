# CustomDialog
New Look for message boxes and dialogs.

This is project created to make a customisable message and confirm dialogs
based on JOptionPane and some of its method features.

The current project can only do message and confirmation box. the input and option dialog will be followed soon.
the CustomDialog.jar was built on JDK 1.8, so to use it, you must use atleast jdk 1.8 and above.

current Dialog capabilites:

1. Change Dialog text such as the Messages, Titles, and Button text.
2. Add Custom icon to the Message and confirmation dialog.
3. Change Background and foreground color of the dialog.
4. Set an image as a background for the dialog frame.
5. Support html tags for better text manipulations.
6. Looks better than the old fashion optionpanes.
7. The dialog can be transparent or opaque.

to show Simple Dialog using this API, do the following code:

CustomDialog.showMessageBox(ParentFrame,"Sample Message.");
                          
to use confirmations, use this sample code:

CustomDialog.showConfirmMessageBox(ParentFrame,"Sample Message.");
                          
for more examples of using this API, you may open the examples from this Repository sources.
Hope you like it! Thanks :)
